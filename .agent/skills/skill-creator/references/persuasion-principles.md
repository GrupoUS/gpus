# Persuasion Principles for Skill Design

Understanding WHY persuasion techniques work helps apply them systematically to skill authoring. Based on Cialdini (2021) and Meincke et al. (2025).

## The Seven Principles

### 1. Authority

**What:** Deference to expertise, credentials, or official sources.

**In skills:** Imperative language ("MUST", "Never", "Always"), non-negotiable framing ("No exceptions"). Eliminates decision fatigue and rationalization.

**When to use:** Discipline-enforcing skills, safety-critical practices, established best practices.

```markdown
✅ Write code before test? Delete it. Start over. No exceptions.
❌ Consider writing tests first when feasible.
```

### 2. Commitment

**What:** Consistency with prior actions, statements, or public declarations.

**In skills:** Require announcements ("Announce skill usage"), force explicit choices, use tracking checklists.

**When to use:** Ensuring skills are followed, multi-step processes, accountability.

```markdown
✅ When you find a skill, you MUST announce: "I'm using [Skill Name]"
❌ Consider letting your partner know which skill you're using.
```

### 3. Scarcity

**What:** Urgency from time limits or sequential dependencies.

**In skills:** Time-bound requirements ("Before proceeding"), sequential dependencies ("Immediately after X"). Prevents procrastination.

**When to use:** Immediate verification requirements, time-sensitive workflows.

```markdown
✅ After completing a task, IMMEDIATELY verify before proceeding.
❌ You can verify when convenient.
```

### 4. Social Proof

**What:** Conformity to what's considered normal.

**In skills:** Universal patterns ("Every time", "Always"), failure modes ("X without Y = failure").

**When to use:** Documenting universal practices, warning about common failures.

```markdown
✅ Checklists without tracking = steps get skipped. Every time.
❌ Some people find tracking helpful for checklists.
```

### 5. Unity

**What:** Shared identity, "we-ness", in-group belonging.

**In skills:** Collaborative language ("our codebase"), shared goals ("we both want quality").

**When to use:** Collaborative workflows, establishing team culture.

```markdown
✅ We're colleagues working together. I need your honest technical judgment.
❌ You should probably tell me if I'm wrong.
```

### 6. Reciprocity

**What:** Obligation to return benefits received.

**When to avoid:** Almost always. Other principles are more effective. Can feel manipulative.

### 7. Liking

**What:** Preference for cooperating with those we like.

**When to avoid:** Always for discipline enforcement. Creates sycophancy, conflicts with honest feedback.

## Principle Combinations by Skill Type

| Skill Type | Primary Principles | Secondary |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Discipline** | Authority + Commitment + Scarcity | Social Proof |
| **Technique** | Authority + Social Proof | Unity |
| **Pattern** | Social Proof + Unity | Authority |
| **Reference** | Authority | (rarely needed) |

## Quick Reference

| Principle | Trigger Phrase | Use For |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Authority | "MUST", "No exceptions" | Rules, enforcement |
| Commitment | "Announce", "Track" | Accountability |
| Scarcity | "Immediately", "Before proceeding" | Urgency |
| Social Proof | "Every time", "Always" | Norms |
| Unity | "We", "Our" | Collaboration |
| Reciprocity | — | Avoid |
| Liking | — | Avoid for discipline |
